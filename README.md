# Panoptic Segmentation Model for Autonomous Car

This repository contains the code implementation for a Panoptic Segmentation model designed for autonomous cars.

## Overview

The Panoptic Segmentation model in this repository combines semantic segmentation and instance segmentation to classify objects in an image and segment them at the pixel level. The model can be used for various tasks, including object detection, tracking, and scene understanding.

## Features

- Utilizes a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for panoptic segmentation.
- Handles both semantic and instance segmentation tasks.
- Provides data preparation scripts for handling labeled image datasets.
- Includes evaluation scripts to measure the performance of the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- Additional requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/aryuemaan/panoptic-segmentation-autonomous-car.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
```

2. Evaluate the trained model:

```
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --data_path /path/to/dataset
```

3. Use the trained model for inference:
